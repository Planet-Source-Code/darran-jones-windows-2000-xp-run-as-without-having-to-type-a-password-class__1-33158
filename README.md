## Windows 2000/XP Run As without having to Type a password class


</div>

### Description

This class enhances the brillant Run as command which ships

with Windows 2000/XP Run As allows you to Run a program as any user

without the need to log on and off.

My RunAs class allows Network Admins to use Run as without having to type in a password this

means you can run a batch file using run as with no user input.

This class uses the API code from my forthcoming RunApp product the only different

is my final product will allow admins to create encrypted files which can be passed into the

excuteable so the username and password won't be exposed in a batch or VBScript file.

To use this class compile it on the server or client you wish to use it

on. Register it using regsvr32 "Path to compiled runas.dll" at the command prompt.
